## Movie Lens Data hw1
Download the dataset and put it into the same folder as your
Jupyter Notebook. The dataset describes movie ratings and user activities from MovieLens, a movie
recommendation service. It contains 316,943 observations (i.e., data objects, rows, etc.). The dataset
includes user id with user demographic information such as gender, age, occupation, zip code. It also
includes movie level information, such as movie id, title, genre, rating, timestamp. Before you start
working on the dataset, you need to convert timestamp column to year and month by placing the few
lines of code below on top of your Notebook 


Once your dataset is ready, answer, by writing an appropriate code for each, the following questions:
1) What unique years are featured in this dataset?
2) How many records are present for each year?
3) Insert a new column called "rating_category" into the dataframe. The column
“rating_category” will have the same value “unknown” for each row.
4) Display the first five rows of the dataframe.
5) Assume that we would like to examine how movie ratings change from first observation (row
    one) to tenth observation (row 10). Draw a line plot for the movie ratings using the first ten rows.
    Do you observe any pattern in the data? If not, discuss why it might not be wise to search for a
    pattern in such type of data.
6) Assume that we would like to examine how movie ratings change across different age groups
for the first one hundred observation. Considering only the first one hundred rows, draw a
scatter plot where the x axis is rating, and y axis is age. Do you observe any pattern in the
data?
